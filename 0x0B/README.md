# Recursion Method

1. Function Definition: define function driven by  **n diemension of input** used for continuous recursion.
    * **consider which conditions(moment) will capture**
2. Break Condition: define break point, which is initial value for the sequence.
    * **consider conditions to handle general previous step**
3. Recursive Chain: study cases and bridge function
    * **consider what & how to do to bridge between steps**
